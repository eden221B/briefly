## âš¡ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

2. **Backend setup**
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev   # runs server on localhost:5050

3. **Frontend setup**
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start     # opens React app on localhost:3000

 **Architecture**

Frontend: React, functional components, useState/useEffect for state

Backend: Node.js + Express, REST APIs for:

Authentication (/api/auth/login, /api/auth/signup)

Product summaries (/api/summaries)

Product comparison (/api/compare)

AI Layer: Currently mocked, can integrate OpenAI / HuggingFace

Data Storage: LocalStorage for session; intended MongoDB for production

 **Workflow**
User â†’ Auth â†’ Add Products â†’ Generate Summaries â†’ Save â†’ Compare â†’ View Results

**Future Considerations**

Scalability: Use proper DB, implement pagination, batch AI processing

Caching: Store generated summaries to reduce repeated AI calls

Monitoring & Logging: Tools like Sentry or Winston

Authentication & Security: Move to JWT / OAuth, enforce HTTPS

Deployment: Containerize backend with Docker, CI/CD automation
